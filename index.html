        <p>Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. The first step
          to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Let's put
          some happy little clouds in our world. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There comes a nice
          little fluffer.</p>
        <p>We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to
          painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. This is
          your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Let's put some highlights on these little
          trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.</p>
        <p>If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Every day I learn. We can fix anything. We have
          no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.</p>
